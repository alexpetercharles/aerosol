# Aerosol 🤖🖌🖼

## About 

My first Machine Learning Project!
This is a DCGAN written with keras for generating random aerosol posters like this:

## Help

Honestly i have close to zero clues what i am doing. I am trying to document this repo
well for my own learning. So if you stumble upon this and have some knowledge about
Keras, GANs or general ML best practises please raise issues or hit me up! ❤️
